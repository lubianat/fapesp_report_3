# Overall Conclusion 



In this PhD project, our exploration has been dedicated to harnessing the potential of Wikidata in advancing scientific research, with a specific emphasis on its application within the Human Cell Atlas and the broader field of bioinformatics.
By leveraging the linked open data structure provided by the platform, we have not only demonstrated its versatility but also presented a compelling argument for its widespread adoption. 
Researchers can tap into the wealth of data offered by Wikidata through direct means, such as executing SPARQL queries, allowing for precise and targeted retrieval of information. 
Furthermore, the integration of Wikidata into ontology workflows enables indirect utilization, enhancing the interoperability and seamless integration of data across domains.

During this process, we have also developed a range of tools and proof-of-concept experiments that highlight the potential of Wikidata for biocuration and scholarmetrics. 
Additionally, we have built a substantial resource comprising species-neutral cell types, a valuable asset for researchers dedicated to cataloging the diversity of human cells.

While we firmly believe in the benefits of Wikidata for the research community, we acknowledge that, for immediate impact, the Cell Ontology remains the primary resource for organizing information about cell types.
Consequently, the natural next step towards ensuring the integration of our efforts with the Human Cell Atlas involves developing tools and operational procedures for connecting Wikidata with OBO Foundry ontologies.

In the final year of our PhD studies, we will allocate time to reflect, visualize, analyze, and produce comprehensive written summaries of our accomplishments. 
This will ensure that the scientific advances we have made are readily accessible to the research community.
