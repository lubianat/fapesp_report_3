# Overall Conclusion 

In summary, in this PhD project so far we explored how Wikidata can aid scientific progress in the context of the Human Cell Atlas and, in a larger perspective, of bioinformatics in general. 
We demonstrate the versatility of the linked open data structure of the platform, on itself an argument for its usage (specially in the context of education), as it provides a set of direct and indirect transferrable skills.
We explored the connection of scientific and metascientific data into the platform, and how this data can be used both directly (via SPARQL queries) and indirectly, by the embedding of Wikidata into the workflow of ontologies. 

Of note, in this process, we also built a series of tools and proof-of-concept experiments that highlight how Wikidata can be used for biocuration and metacuration.
In the meanwhile, we built the largest resource of species-neutral cell types, certainly a valuable resource for any scientist devoted to catalog the diversity of human cells.
While we are convinced of the benefits of Wikidata for the researcher landscapes, we also realize that for immediate impact, the Cell Ontology is the resource of reference for organizing the information about cell types. 
Thus, the natural next step to ensure all this efforts impacts the Human Cell Atlas is by developing tooling and operating procedures to connect Wikidata and OBO Foundry ontologies.

Lastly, for the last year of PhD studies, we will dedicate the time to reflect, visualize, analyse, and produce writings summarizing what has been done, thereby making sure the scientific advances here reported are clearly acessible by the research community.
