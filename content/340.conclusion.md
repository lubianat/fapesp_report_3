# Overall Conclusion 



Throughout this PhD project, our work has been dedicated to harnessing the potential of Wikidata to enhance scientific research, with a specific focus on its application within the Human Cell Atlas and the broader field of bioinformatics.
By leveraging the linked open data structure provided by the platform, we have not only demonstrated its versatility, but also presented a compelling case for its widespread adoption. 
Researchers can directly tap into the wealth of data offered by Wikidata, such as executing SPARQL queries, allowing for precise and targeted retrieval of information. 
Moreover, the incorporation of Wikidata into ontology workflows enables indirect utilization, enhancing the interoperability and seamless integration of data across various domains.

During this process, we have also developed a variety of tools and proof-of-concept experiments that underscore the potential of Wikidata for biocuration and scholarmetrics. 
In addition, we have constructed a substantial resource comprising species-neutral cell types, a valuable asset for researchers focused on cataloging the diversity of human cells.

While we are firm believers in the benefits of Wikidata for the research community, we recognize that, for immediate impact, the Cell Ontology remains the primary resource for organizing information about cell types.
Therefore, the logical next step towards ensuring the integration of our efforts with the Human Cell Atlas involves developing tools and operational procedures for linking Wikidata with OBO Foundry ontologies.

In the final year of our PhD studies, we will dedicate time to reflect, visualize, analyze, and produce comprehensive written summaries of our accomplishments. 
This will ensure that the scientific advances we have made are easily accessible to the research community.
