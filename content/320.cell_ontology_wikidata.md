## Curation and mapping of Cell Ontology to Wikidata {.page_break_before}

### Introduction


In our experience, bioscientists are wary on using resources like Wikipedia and Wikidata in professional settings, but the Cell Ontology and other OBO Foundry ontologies have a much better reach, and are used widely for knowledge management in the context of the Human Cell Atlas project.[@wikidata:Q109755180]
This realization lead to a decision on not promoting Wikidata use directly by the Human Cell Atlas community, but instead investing time in connecting Wikidata to OBO Foundry ontologies.
During the course of the work, we identified five core benefits of integrating Wikidata to the ontology ecosystem, outlined below. 


First, Wikidata is multilingual, and can provide identifiers in hundreds of languages. 
This is in stark contrast with the ontologies and controlled vocabularies world, extremely anglocentric.
The multilingualism can be factored in internationalization and localization of tools, but also as seeds for natural language algorithms to parse and tag non-English corpora. 


Second, Wikidata has tight links to Wikipedia. 
Ontology consumers (such as CELLXGENE [@https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.438318v1] and its ontology browser for single-cell RNA-seq datasets, <https://onto.cellxgene-labs.prod.si.czi.technology/a/ontology>) often find themselves in need of textual descriptions of the concepts, which is not the focus of ontology developers. 
Thus, Wikidata mappings can provide Wikipedia connections, increasing the possibilities for developers and curators using the ontology. 

Third, Wikidata has also links to many resources and controlled vocabularies beyond Wikipedia. 
Even though most biocurated resources provide some degree of mapping (cross-references) to other resources, Wikidata plays the role of an identifier hub to connect ontologies with MeSH terms, the UMLS vocabulary, entries on libraries and encyclopedias and more.
These extended links can help ontologies to grow and refine themselves by cross-validating information with other curating teams.

Fourth: Wikidata's community presents a platform to validate and gather decentralized feedback on the platform with respect to new axioms and new classes, as well as on the consistency of existing classes. 
For example, in Figure @fig:cl_multimappings we display one case in which the existence of multiple Wikidata-to-CL mappings allowed us to discover an inconsistency in CL in relation to common classification of cell types on Wikipedia, which separate "multinucleate cell" into two different entities, "coenocytic cell" and "syncitial cell".
The discovery led to a ticket on the Cell Ontology issue tracker, to be worked on in the future.

B) The CL entry for "multinucleate cell", showing "syncitium" as a synonym. C) The Wikipedia page, describing two types of multinucleate cells: syncitia and coenocytes. D) An open ticket in the Cell Ontology GitHub Issue Tracker to start the discussion towards normalizing the structure.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lubianat/phd_figures/master/cell_ontology/wikidata_multi_mappings_to_improve_cell_ontology.png){#fig:cl_multimappings width="85%"}

Finally, Wikidata provides an easy to enter platform for newcomers without extensive ontology traning. 
It provides tutorials, manuals and tooling targeting lay users and if properly integrated to the ontology workflow, Wikidata can serve as a first-pass platform for new term and new axiom suggestions.
While contributing to ontologies require download and configuration of the Protege platform (<https://protege.stanford.edu/>), as well as familiarity with GitHub workflows, contributing to Wikidata has a much lower barrier. 
Wikidata, thus, serves as a gateway for ontology development, and can play a key role in the knowledge management ecosystem. 

### Methods
#### Wikidata and the Cell Ontology interplay

To map Cell Ontology on Wikidata, we proposed and got the approval of a specific Wikidata identifier for the Cell Ontology, the "Cell Ontology ID" (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P7963>).
After approval, identifiers can be added to Wikidata entities to connect them to external databases enabling integrative SPARQL queries. 
Besides using the common Wikidata interface, one can crowd-curate identifiers via a 3rd-party service, Mix'N'Match, which provides a user-friendly framework for connecting identifier catalogs to Wikidata. 
As a first step in curation, we created a Mix'N'Match catalog for harmonizing Cell Ontology (exemplified in Figure @fig:mixnmatch_cl) IDs to Wikidata (<https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/#/catalog/4719>), harnessing the community support for the task.

#### The WDCuration Python package

A beneficial offshoot of the effort to curate cell types (and metascientific information, as discussed in the following chapter) was the creation of an open-source Python package for real-time curation of information to Wikidata. 
The WDCuration package (<https://github.com/lubianat/wdcuration>) introduces a suite of functions that provide:

  * The ability to input a term of interest and a JSON dictionary mapping strings to Wikidata IDs, and then search the dictionary for an exact match.
  * If the term is not in the dictionary, initiate a lookup on Wikidata via ElasticSearch and returns the best match for the term.
  * Await for the user selection to confirm if the match is accurate or input a new, manually-acquired match.
  * Update of the JSON dictionary with a label-to-Wikidata mapping.

The tool also allows customization of the Wikidata search by leveraging knowledge graph structure, for example including only "instances of --> cell type" or excluding all "instance of --> scientific article" triples. 

The WDCuration package played a crucial role in mapping cell terms in the Cell Ontology, as each term was cross-referenced against the database. 
During the curation process, we noticed that approximately half of the terms in the Cell Ontology (~1300) were already present on Wikidata (either historically or via WikidataBib curation), and the remaining 1300 were created automatically, with individual checks and individual, statement-level references to the Cell Ontology.

### Results
By early December 2022, over 700 Cell Ontology IDs had been manually cross-referenced with Wikidata, utilizing both the graphic user interface and the Mix'n'Match platform.
The scope of the curation effort was subsequently expanded to include manual curation of the outstanding Wikidata-Cell Ontology links, including creating new classes for the absent Cell Ontology terms.
To curate these links, we developed a workflow that synergized ROBOT (a tool for automating ontology workflows) [@wikidata:Q92260004] and a custom package for real-time curation of natural language terms to Wikidata, wdcuration (<https://github.com/lubianat/wdcuration>).
The code used for integrating CL with Wikidata is accessible at <https://github.com/lubianat/cl_match_to_wikidata>.
As of May 12th, 2023, Wikidata boasts 2636 cross-references to the Cell Ontology, effectively covering all terms in the ontology.

One immediate result of the curation effort was a list of cell types featured on Wikipedia, indicating their general notability, but missing from the Cell Ontology. 
The SPARQL query below presents an example of such results, exploring the graph structure to extract neurons that lack a CL identifier, but are included in English Wikipedia. 
It's important to note that the query excludes sensory receptors, as these are not modelled by CL due to their classification as either multicellular or subcellular structures in different contexts. 
The result of the query (see Code Snippet 1) as of May 12, 2023, is presented in @tbl:neurons_on_wikipedia. However, a live version of the query can be executed in the Wikidata Query Service. (<https://w.wiki/6hJT>)
