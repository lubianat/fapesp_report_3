## Curation and mapping of Cell Ontology to Wikidata {.page_break_before}

### Introduction


While, in our experience, bioscientists are relutant on using resources like Wikipedia and Wikidata in professional settings, the Cell Ontology and other OBO Foundry ontologies are currently used strongly n the context of the Human Cell Atlas project.[@wikidata:Q109755180]
This realization lead to a decision on not promoting Wikidata use directly by the Human Cell Atlas community, but instead  
invest time in connecting Wikidata with the Cell Ontology as a stepping stone to wider Wikidata-OBO integration.

The connection of Wikidata with ontologies has a variety of potential benefits for the ecosystem. 
First, Wikidata is multilingual, and can provide identifiers in hundreds of languages. 
This is in stark contrast with the ontologies and controlled vocabularies world, extremely anglocentric.

Second, Wikidata has tight links to Wikipedia. 
Ontology consumers (such as CELLXGENE

and its ontology browser for single-cell RNA-seq datasets

ADD REFERENCE

) often find themselves in need of textual descriptions of the concepts, which is not the focus of ontology developers. 
Thus, Wikidata mappings can provide Wikipedia connections, increasing the possibilities for developers and curators using the ontology. 

Third, Wikidata has also links to many different resources and controlled vocabularies beyond Wikipedia. 
Even though most biocurated resources provide some degree of mapping (cross-references) to other resources, Wikidata plays the role of an identifier hub to connect ontologies with MeSH terms, the UMLS vocabulary, entries on libraries and encyclopedias and more.

Fourth: Wikidata's community presents a platform to validate and gather decentralized feedback on the platform with respect to new axioms and new classes, as well as on the consistency of existing classes. I
For example, in @fig:cl_multimappings we display one case in which the existence of multiple Wikidata-to-CL mappings allowed us to discover an inconsistency in CL in relation to common classification of cell types on Wikipedia, which separate "multinucleate cell" into two different entities, "coenocytic cell" and "syncitial cell".
The discovery led to a ticket on the Cell Ontology issue tracker, to be worked on in the future. 

![Wikidata's community curation helps Cell Ontology to improve. A) The entry for "multinucleate cell" showing a constraint violation, as the CL identifiers is also used in "syncitium". B) The CL entry for "multinucleate cell", showing "syncitium" as a synonym. C) The Wikipedia page, describing two types of multinucleate cells: syncitia and coenocytes. D) An open ticket in the Cell Ontology GitHub Issue Tracker to start the discussion towards normalizing the structure.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lubianat/phd_figures/master/cell_ontology/wikidata_multi_mappings_to_improve_cell_ontology.png){#fig:cl_multimappings width="85%"}

Finally, Wikidata provides an easy to enter structure to contribute, and if properly integrated to the Cell Ontology workflow, it can serve as a first-pass platform for new term suggestions.
While contributing to ontologies require download and configuration of the Protege platform, as well as familiarity with GitHub workflows, contributing to Wikidata has a much lower barrier. 
Wikidata, thus, serves as a gateway for ontology development, and can play a key role in the knowledge management ecosystem. 

### Methods
#### Wikidata and the Cell Ontology interplay

To map Cell Ontology on Wikidata, we proposed and got the approval of a specific Wikidata identifier for the Cell Ontology, the "Cell Ontology ID" (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P7963>).
IDs can be added to Wikidata entities and connected them to external databases enabling integrative SPARQL queries. 
Besides using the common Wikidata interface, one can crowd-curate identifiers via a 3rd-party service, Mix'N'Match, which provides a user-friendly framework for connecting identifier catalogues to Wikidata. [@url:http://magnusmanske.de/wordpress/?p=114], as seen in Figure @fig:mixn_match_cl. 
Logically, we created a Mix'N'Match catalogue for harmonizing Cell Ontology IDs to Wikidata (<https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/#/catalog/4719>), harnessing the community support for the task.

#### The WDCuration Python package

A subproduct of the effort to curate cell types (and metascientific information, see the following chapter) was the development of an open-source Python package for on-demand curation of information to Wikidata. 
The WDCuration package (https://github.com/lubianat/wdcuration) implements a set of functions that provide the following functionality:
  * Given a term of interest and a JSON dictionary mapping strings to Wikidata IDS, lookup up the dictionary for an exact match
  * If the term is not in the dictionary, lookup Wikidata for it via ElasticSearch and return the best match for the term
  * Let the user decide if the match is correct OR enter a new, manually-accessed match
  * Update the JSON dictionary with a label-to-Wikidata mapping

The tool also allows tweaking of the Wikidata search by adding knowledge graph information, and including only "instances of --> cell type" or excluding all "instance of --> scientific article". 

The WDCuration package was instrumental in the mapping of cell terms in the Cell Ontology, as each term was checked against the database. About half the terms of the Cell Ontology (~1300) were already present on Wikidata, and the other 1300 were created automatically, with individual checks, with indiviual, statement-level references to the Cell Ontology.


### Results

As of early December 2022, more than 700 Cell Ontology IDs had been manually matched to Wikidata, both via the graphic user interface and with the Mix'n'Match platform. 
The integration already enables queries that harness the previously existing information on Wikidata for Cell Ontology-based applications. 
For example, one can query Wikidata items that have (1) a crossref to a CL ID (2) a picture in Wikimedia Commons (<https://w.wiki/4F6e>, Figure @fig:cl_images). 
The different possibilities of mutual benefit between the Cell Ontology and Wikidata will continue to be explored in the following years of this PhD project.

The curation effort was expanded, with manual curation of the missing Wikidata - Cell Ontology links, including the creation of new classes for the missing Cell Ontology terms.
As of May 12th, 2023, Wikidata contains 2636 cross references to the Cell Ontology, covering virtually all terms in the ontology.
For the curation of the linkes, we developed a workflow that combined ROBOT (a tool for automating ontology workflows) [@wikidata:Q92260004] with a custom package for on-demand curation of natural language terms to Wikidata, wdcuration (https://github.com/lubianat/wdcuration).
The code for integration of CL to Wikidata is available at https://github.com/lubianat/cl_match_to_wikidata.


The curation effort had as an immediate outcome a list of cell types represented on Wikipedia, and thus of general notability, but missing from the Cell Ontology. 
The SPARQL query below outlines one of such results, by navigating the graph structure to extract neurons that do not have a CL identifier, but are present on English Wikipedia. 
Note that the query excludes sensory receptors, as these are not modelled by CL, as sometimes they are considered multicelluar structures and, in other cases, subcellular structures. 
The result of the query as of May 12 2023 is presented in the table below, but a live version of the query can be run in the Wikidata Query Service. (https://w.wiki/6hJT)
