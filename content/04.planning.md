# Next steps  {.page_break_before}

After this second year of work, the next steps of this PhD project will be geared towards robustifying the systems for biocuration and improving the quality of cell type information on Wikidata.
This robustification will pave the way for the final phase of the project, where we plan to incorporate the organized information on Wikidata to standar workflows of single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.

In particular, the next part of the project includes the following steps:

* Develop Wikidata Bib into a mature system and deploy it as Open Source Software for the research community

* Improve the semantic infrastructure on Wikidata for handling knowledge about cell types

    * Establish a comprehensive catalog of cell types on Wikidata
    * Develop a portal for access and re-use of the Wikidata database, e.g. providing datasets for enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
    * Complete the mapping between Wikidata and Cell Ontology, as a stepping stone for integrating Wikidata in existing frameworks
  
* Improve the quality of bibliometric data on Wikidata, laying the foundations to ensure complete coverage of the Brazilian contributions to the Human Cell Atlas
