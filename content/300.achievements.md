# Accomplishments {.page_break_before}

In our project's third year, we prioritized the investigation of Wikidata as a significant participant in the bioinformatics ecosystem, specifically with regard to the Human Cell Atlas.
We developed a structured biocuration routine and built a software tool for curating new cell types from literature into Wikidata.
After investing significant time and effort, we succeeded in establishing Wikidata as an advanced reference database for cells, resulting in a catalog of more than 6000 cell classes and a complete mapping between the Cell Ontology and Wikidata.
We also explored the metascientific potential of Wikidata, not only to represent information about cell types, but also to utilize the graph structure to gain insights into the research community.
In the process, we produced two Python modules: wdcuration, which allows on-the-fly curation of natural language terms into Wikidata, and PyOrcidator, a tool for reconciling information from ORCID Profiles with Wikidata.
These tools were employed in our curation efforts to map the Brazilian bioinformatics landscape and provide insights related to specific academic events.
