# Achievements {.page_break_before}

In the project's third year, we focused on active exploration of the Wikidata platform as a contributor to the bioinformatics ecosystem, with a focus on the Human Cell Atlas. 
After formalizing a biocuration routine and building software to curate new cell types from the literature to Wikidata, we dedicated time to consolidating Wikidata as a state-of-the-art reference database for cells, leading to a catalog of over 6000 cell classes, as well as curating a complete mapping between the Cell Ontology and Wikidata. 
We also focused our effort on the metascientific potential of Wikidata, to represent not only information about cell types, but to leverage the graph structure to gain insights on the research community. 
As a byproduct of this endeavour, two python modules were produced: wdcuration, for on-demand fly-by curation of natural language terms to Wikidata, and PyOrcidator, a reconciler of information from ORCID Profiles to Wikidata. 
These tools were connected to curation efforts to map the landscape of Brazilian bioinformatics, as well as to provide insights in relation to particular academic events.
