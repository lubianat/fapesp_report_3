## Mapping the metascience on bioinformatics onto Wikidata {.page_break_before}

### Introduction

During the development of this project we came to realize the potential of Wikidata to represent not only scientific concepts, but also metascientific concepts. 
Besides capturing information about the world, Wikidata has been developed as a platform to capture structured data on the sources for encoded statements. 
In other words, Wikidata became a citation repository, containing structured information on tens of millions of scientific articles.
This project was spearheaded by WikiCite, an organization dedicated to improve citations in the context of Wikimedia projects. 
The information encoded on Wikidata powers the provenance infrastructure of the platform, enabling queries to, for example, list the articles that were used as source of the cell types in the platform (Figure @fig:cell_type_sources).

The modelling of metadata about articles gradually expanded in scope, and Wikidata developed infrastructure to model other aspects of the publication landscape: theses, preprints, authors, institutions, research topics, academic software, conferences and more. 
One project, Scholia, rose as a platform showcasing Wikidata, SPARQL-based automatic profiles for different entities in academia. [@wikidata:Q41799194]
The insights provided by Scholia, such as co-author graphs and topic scores for institutions, triggered us to think about the biological knowledge graph in Wikidata in a broader sense, including not only the scientific concepts but also the players in the bioknowledge ecosystem.    

Given this potential of the platform, we invested time in expanding tooling and coverage of Wikidata for bioinformatics information, with a focus in the Brazilian bioinformatics community and in the context of the Human Cell atlas. 
In this chapter, we describe the PyOrcidator package, to integrate information from the ORCID platform to Wikidata on demand, a project to map the Brazilian bioinformatics landscape to Wikidata, a semantic catalog of USP Bioinformatics thesis and, finally an example of how to use the Wikidata infrastructure to get insights on particular academic events.


### Methods

Our process of building a metascientific knowledge graph and then displaying it to the community consisted of several steps, from data modelling to visualization. 
After identifying an analytical scope, we manually made the core Wikidata entries for entities, adding aspects such as the location and parent institutions of programs, and start and end dates for academic events.  
Then, we used web scraping in Python to recover lists of related people, and manually reconciled the names to Wikidata, using both WDCuration and a set of other tools, such as the Wikipedia and Wikidata add-on for Google Sheets (<https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/wikipedia_and_wikidata_tools/595109124715>)and the Open Refine data curation platform (<https://openrefine.org/>)

For each person, we run the PyOrcidator tool (described below) to update information on Wikidata, as well as other tools such as AuthorDisambiguator to disambiguate articles to their authors. 
Finally, to visualize the information, we wrote a series of SPARQL queries and/or used Scholia's standard SPARQL queries, to generate insights and visualizations on the graph.
Due to the ever-updating nature of the curation effort, we made sure that all subprojects had online, live dashboards either independently on GitHub Pages or on the Scholia platform.

#### PyOrcidator

One of the most important aspects of biomedical knowledge is the biomedical researcher. 
By having accurate metadata on people, we empower our community to better tailor its projects to the society.
For example, actionable metadata on affiliations, gender and (if public sources are available) ethnicity can help Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) efforts. 
In the context of the Human Cell Atlas, it can help us identify biases and gaps in publications and events, and thus tweak the actions around the community to help the project to reach its goals. 
It can also help academic departments and programs to know more about its academic output, and use this data for improvement.

Currently, ORCID has risen as the core international standardized provider of academic curricula for individuals. [@wikidata:Q30512726] Even though _Currículo Lattes_ is the standard for academic curricula in Brazil, we focused on ORCID for its better international coverage, its open Application Program Interface, and its clear CC0 (public domain dedication) license, which enables reuse of the metadata. 
The ORCID API provides semi-structured information for every researcher, including DOIs for the listed publications. 
Most information provided, however, is in the form of natural language, meaning that users enter their affiliations and topics of research in free-format fields. 
That feature makes it harder, for example, to query ORCID for all members of a particular research institution, as names may be written in a myriad of different ways. 

The PyOrcidator tool combines parsing of the ORCID API with dictionary handling using WDCuration, enabling curators to map, on demand, the free labels of ORCID to the numeric identifiers of Wikidata.
It stores tree dictionaries, one for roles (e.g. "PhD Student", "Lead developer"), one for institutions (e.g. "University of São Paulo", "FioCruz") and one for topics (e.g. "Cell biology", "bioinformatics").
Users of the package clone the GitHub repository with the containing dictionaries, perform curation on demand and push the changes back to GitHub.
This decentralized curation enables gradual mapping of institution labels to Wikidata, effectively allowing reuse of curation effort.

For each ORCID, PyORCIDator generates a file in the Quickstatements format containing the triples that will be updated in the knowledge graph, including cross-identifiers present in ORCID (e.g. to Twitter and ResearchGate), the affiliations and education information, the topics studied and the publications for the author.
The PyORCIDator package is instrumental for the mapping of academic programs and conferences to Wikidata, enabling targeted curation of the metadata for the researchers of interest.

### The Landscape of Brazilian Bioinformatics

To exercise Wikidata as a framework for cataloging scientific metadata, we set ourselves to the task of designing a map of the stakeholders in Brazilian bioinformatics. 

We created Wikidata entries for several bioinformatics programs in Brazil, and mapped the researchers affiliated to each of them on Wikidata. 
We also assumed that any researcher affiliated to a core bioinformatics program could also receive a triple stating "field of work --> bioinformatics".
For determining the people in scope of the project, we decided to filter for the following constraints: 

 1. People that have the triple "field of work (P101) --> bioinformatics (Q128570)"
 2. People that have some relation - "employed by (P108)", "affiliated to (P1416)",  "member of (P463)" or "educated at (P63)" to an institution that has the triple "country (P17) --> Brazil (Q155)". 

 We decided on that loose mapping to reach bioinformaticians in Brazil widely, even those that are not affiliated to a bioinformatics-only academic program. 
 Besides our individual curation of the academic programs, we organized a 2-day virtual event in November 2023 that gathered people from across Brazil to share their perspectives and aid in the curation effort. 

The final product of the mapping is a live dashboard on the landscape of Brazilian bioinformatics that can be accessed at
https://lubianat.github.io/bioinfo_brasil/dashboard, highlighted in Figure @fig:landscape_of_bioinformatics. 
The dashboard contains a series of SPARQL query results showcasing different facets of the Brazilian bioinformatics, such as the giant co-authorship component (Figure @fig:landscape_of_bioinformatics A-B) with few separate communities, and the bias towards institutions in the United States and Europe for study and work.

#### USP Bioinformatics Thesis

Besides the mapping of the bioinformatics researcher, we dedicated time to model and gather insights on the theses and dissertations produced by students at the University of São Paulo Graduate Program in Bioinformatics (also available at <https://lubianat.github.io/bioinfo_brasil/dashboard>)
Metadata for each publication was parsed from the "Teses USP" repository into a curation framework, where committee members and topics were curated from free text into Wikidata identifiers. 
Each publication, then, was created as a new item on Wikidata containing the reconciled metadata, making them available for querying. 

In Figure {@fig:bioinformatics_theses}A, we see "bioinformatics" as the common main topic, but also concepts such as "transcriptome", "metagenomics" and "single-nucleotide polymorphisms", denoting the variety of subjects within the scope of the program.  In @fig:bioinformatics_theses B, we note that Prof. Helder Nakaya, the supervisor of this project, is the person that most attended defenses of the program. This data does not discern between own students and invitations, and thus this bias needs to be taken into account. 

Figure {@fig:bioinformatics_theses}C presents a co-participation in bioinformatics defense committee network. 
We reasoned that, similar to co-authorship graphs, a committee co-participation network could bring insights into the soft structures of science. 
In this network, the presence of smaller, disconnected subcomponents, such as the one highlighted in Figure {@fig:bioinformatics_theses}D, highlight different communities of practice.
In this case, the 3 professors of the program in the subgraph, Prof. Júlia Pavan, Prof. Anatoli Iambartsev  and Prof. Antonio Galves are all from the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, perhaps signaling a difference in the type of research performed and evaluated.


In addition to collecting factual evidence, the open metascientific maps on Wikidata offer valuable insights into the hidden structures of science.
They provide a democratic way to navigate academic affinities, revealing patterns in coauthorship and committee thesis participation. 
These maps have obvious applications in improving academic structures and detecting fraudulent schemes. 
However, they also have important non-obvious applications. 
By openly encoding the metascientific structure, newcomers and young scientists gain a better understanding of the inner workings of an academic career, increasing their chances of success.

### Event-based curation - Natal Bioinformatics Forum 2023

With the end of the COVID-19 pandemic health emergency, academic conferences started to happen again. 
Academic events are at the core of modern scientific practice, facilitating the interaction of individuals from diverse backgrounds and the initiation of novel projects. 
everaging state-of-the-art Linked Open Data standards to structure event-level information can greatly benefit participants, organizers, and funders. For instance, co-author graphs of attendees and speakers can pinpoint opportunities for collaboration. Similarly, metadata pertaining to location and gender can assist organizers in enhancing event diversity.
In this report, we illustrate the application of a knowledge graph using the speakers' network at the Natal Bioinformatics Forum, an academic conference held in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, in March 2023.

The information for speakers was scraped, reconciled to Wikidata, and curated on the platform, and made available in a dashboard at <https://lubianat.github.io/natal_bioinformatics2wikidata/>. 
In @fig:natal_bioinformatics A, we can observe the co-authorship relations of the speakers in the event. 
Prof. Ana Tereza Vasconcelos emerges as a central figure in the graph, acting as a connecting hub across various subcomponents. The significance of these relationships became evident during her presentation at the event. Prof. Ana Tereza is recognized as one of the pioneers in the field of bioinformatics in Brazil and has been actively publishing in this domain for several decades, establishing extensive collaborations throughout her career.

The mapping of the event to Wikidata also enable a quick overview of the kinds of software the speakers used in their publications. 
Besides the imaging software ImageJ, we could see a bias towards R packages for dealing with transcriptomics, such as "edgeR", "DESeq2", "limma" and "affy", also illustrating a bit the inner practices of the community. 
Finally, the map of affiliations of the speakers shows a clear bias towards United States and Europe. 
Strikingly, Latin American institutions were absent from the academic history of the speakers, and even inside Brazil, we see 2 localized clusters, one in the south-southwest and the other in a small part of the northwest.
The affiliations maps are powerful tools for identifying geographic biases and, hopefully, addressing them in the future.

### Discussion 

#### Contextualization with the Human Cell Atlas

The metascientific analysis described here is relevant not only to Brazilian bioinformatics but also to understanding and addressing gaps in the Human Cell Atlas. 
We have started curating the metadata of Human Cell Atlas Publications (<https://www.humancellatlas.org/publications/#>, <https://w.wiki/6hzz>) on Wikidata, providing a new means to examine biases (geographic and otherwise) within the project. 
This is particularly important in the context of the HCA, as one of its core missions is to create an atlas that is representative of human diversity. 
Additionally, we are currently mapping the speakers and poster presenters of the Human Cell Atlas General Meeting 2023 on Wikidata, aiming to gain insights into the event and the HCA community.
