## Mapping the metascience on bioinformatics onto Wikidata {.page_break_before}

### Introduction

Throughout the development of this project, we recognized Wikidata's potential to represent not only scientific concepts but also scholarly metadata. 
Wikidata serves as more than a platform for capturing information about the world; it also stores structured data on the sources for encoded statements, making it a citation repository containing structured data on tens of millions of scientific articles.
This initiative was led by WikiCite, a project dedicated to improving citations in the context of Wikimedia platforms. 
The citation metadata on Wikidata fuels the platform's provenance system, enabling queries like listing the articles used as sources for cell types in the platform (Figure @fig:cell_type_sources).

Wikidata's metascientific scope has progressively broadened, developing an infrastructure to represent other aspects of the publication landscape like theses, preprints, authors, institutions, research topics, academic software, conferences, and more. 
One project, Scholia, emerged as a platform showcasing Wikidata, creating SPARQL-based automatic profiles for different entities in academia. [@wikidata:Q41799194]
Scholia's insights, like co-author graphs and topic scores for institutions, prompted us to think more broadly about the biological knowledge graph in Wikidata, including not only scientific concepts but also the players in the bioknowledge ecosystem.    

Recognizing the platform's potential, we dedicated time to enhance Wikidata's tooling and coverage for bioinformatics information, focusing on the Brazilian bioinformatics community and the Human Cell Atlas context. 
In this chapter, we outline the PyOrcidator package, a tool to integrate information from the ORCID platform to Wikidata on demand, a project to map the Brazilian bioinformatics landscape to Wikidata, a semantic catalog of USP Bioinformatics thesis, and an example of how to leverage Wikidata's infrastructure to gain insights on specific academic events.


### Methods

Our process of building a metascientific knowledge graph and then displaying it to the community consisted of several steps, from data modelling to visualization. 
After identifying an analytical scope, we manually made the core Wikidata entries for entities, adding aspects such as the location and parent institutions of programs, and start and end dates for academic events.  
Then, we used web scraping in Python to recover lists of related people, and manually reconciled the names to Wikidata, using both WDCuration and a set of other tools, such as the Wikipedia and Wikidata add-on for Google Sheets (<https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/wikipedia_and_wikidata_tools/595109124715>)and the Open Refine data curation platform (<https://openrefine.org/>)

For each identified person, we pulled the ORCID identifier and run the PyOrcidator tool (a python package to integrade ORCIDs to Wikidata developed in this project and available at https://github.com/lubianat/pyorcidator) to update the information on Wikidata, as well as other tools such as AuthorDisambiguator to disambiguate articles to their authors. 
Finally, to visualize the information, we wrote a series of SPARQL queries and/or used Scholia's standard SPARQL queries, to generate insights and visualizations on the graph.
Due to the ever-updating nature of the curation effort, we made sure that all subprojects had online, live dashboards either independently on GitHub Pages or on the Scholia platform.

### The Landscape of Brazilian Bioinformatics

To exercise Wikidata as a framework for cataloging scientific metadata, we set ourselves to the task of designing a map of the stakeholders in Brazilian bioinformatics. 

We created Wikidata entries for several bioinformatics programs in Brazil, and mapped the researchers affiliated to each of them on Wikidata. 
We also assumed that any researcher affiliated to a core bioinformatics program also had bioinformatics as field of work.
For determining the people in scope of the project, we decided to filter for the following constraints: 

 1. People that have the triple "field of work (P101) --> bioinformatics (Q128570)"
 2. People that have some relation - "employed by (P108)", "affiliated to (P1416)",  "member of (P463)" or "educated at (P63)" - to an institution that has the triple "country (P17) --> Brazil (Q155)". 

 We decided on that loose mapping to reach bioinformaticians in Brazil widely, even those that are not affiliated to a bioinformatics-only academic program. 
 Besides our individual curation of the academic programs, we organized a 2-day virtual event in November 2023 that gathered people from across Brazil to share their perspectives and aid in the curation effort. 

The final product of the mapping is a live dashboard on the landscape of Brazilian bioinformatics that can be accessed at
https://lubianat.github.io/bioinfo_brasil/dashboard, highlighted in Figure @fig:landscape_of_bioinformatics. 
The dashboard contains a series of SPARQL query results showcasing different facets of the Brazilian bioinformatics, such as the giant co-authorship component (Figure @fig:landscape_of_bioinformatics A-B) with few separate communities, and the bias towards institutions in the United States and Europe for study and work.

### Event-based curation 

#### Natal Bioinformatics Forum 2023

With the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic health emergency, academic conferences have resumed. 
These events form the bedrock of contemporary scientific practice, enabling interaction among individuals from diverse backgrounds and sparking the initiation of new projects. 
Leveraging state-of-the-art Linked Open Data standards to structure event-level information can provide significant benefits to participants, organizers, and funders. For example, co-author graphs of attendees and speakers can identify potential collaborations. Similarly, metadata related to location and gender can help organizers enhance event diversity.
In this report, we demonstrate the application of a knowledge graph using the speakers' network at the Natal Bioinformatics Forum, an academic conference held in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, in March 2023.

We scraped the speakers' information, reconciled it with Wikidata, curated it on the platform, and made it accessible through a dashboard at <https://lubianat.github.io/natal_bioinformatics2wikidata/>. 
In Figure {@fig:natal_bioinformatics}A, we can view the co-authorship relations among the event's speakers. 
Prof. Ana Tereza Vasconcelos appears as a central figure in the graph, serving as a connecting hub across various subcomponents. The importance of these relationships was highlighted during her presentation at the event. Prof. Ana Tereza is acknowledged as one of the pioneers in the field of bioinformatics in Brazil and has been actively publishing in this field for several decades, forming extensive collaborations throughout her career.

The reconlitiation the event to Wikidata also enabled a quick overview of the types of software used by the speakers in their publications as one can see in Figure {@fig:natal_bioinformatics}B.
Apart from the imaging software ImageJ, we noticed a preference for R packages dealing with transcriptomics, such as "edgeR", "DESeq2", "limma", and "affy". This also sheds light on the community's inner practices. 

Lastly, the map of the speakers' affiliations in Figure {@fig:natal_bioinformatics}C reveals once more a clear bias towards the United States and Europe. 
Remarkably, Latin American institutions were absent from the speakers' academic history. Even within Brazil, we observe two localized clusters: one in the south-southwest and the other in a small part of the northwest.
These affiliation maps are potent tools for identifying geographic biases and, hopefully, for addressing them in future events.

#### Contextualization with the Human Cell Atlas

The metascientific analysis outlined here is not only relevant to Brazilian bioinformatics, but also to understanding and addressing gaps within the Human Cell Atlas. 
We have begun curating the metadata of Human Cell Atlas Publications (<https://www.humancellatlas.org/publications/#>, <https://w.wiki/6hzz>) on Wikidata, offering a novel approach to scrutinize biases (geographic and others) within the project. 
This is particularly significant in the context of the HCA, as one of its core objectives is to construct an atlas that accurately represents human diversity. 
Furthermore, we are in the process of mapping the speakers and poster presenters of the Human Cell Atlas General Meeting 2023 on Wikidata, with the goal of gaining insights into the event and the HCA community.
